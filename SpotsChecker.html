        <h2>SpotsChecker</h2>
        <h4>Product Design</h4>
        <p>I joined SAP Lab Canada in 2015 as an interaction designer under their emerging technology team. During my time there, I work with developers to design and develop <strong>SpotChecker</strong>, an in-house DNA Testing iPad application, to mitigate food fraud in retailer's supply chain.</p>

        <h5>Why retailers need a solution for food fraud?</h5>

        <p>I began the process by understanding the problem space for target audience groups. Firstly, I researched on what is food fraud and understand that it is widespread nowadays. </p>

        <p>Under this context, retailers are feeling the pain of food fraud due to the following reasons: </p>

        </ul>
        <h5>Friendly, digestible, and human design.</h5>
        <p>Knowing that the clients heavily rely on the phone to do any kind of business, I felt that it was important to create a space that could be tangible and accessible through mobile. Talking with the rest of the team, I have decided the plan should be shared through email and provide the sales representative’s contact clearly.</br>
        </br>
        In order for the representatives to share the business plans and reports, I decided on creating a sharing modal that is friendly, digestible, and human to align with the rest of Facebook business design.</br>
        </br>
        In order to build trust with our users, I wanted to make sure that the representatives shared the business plans and reports every step of the way through out the entire process of TRP buying, which consists of creating a campaign plan, buying it, and running it.</p>

        <h5>Challenging the initial idea to think from a different perspective.</h5>
        <img src="http://cdn.getforge.com/jeongsteph.com/1445215728/images/fb1.png">
        <p>I began by conducting competitive analysis on sharing modals from other products such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Quip, and others. I picked out flow patterns from these products to create a generic, simple sharing modal. During this wire framing stage, I learned to work with the engineers to create prototypes that align with the Facebook Business design guidelines.</br>
        </br>
        While this version was concise, it didn’t align with our initial goal of creating a tool that’s friendly and human. I wondered how we could let users share in a more personalized way. After brainstorming with the rest of the team, I came to the idea of showing the actual email template the representatives will be sending to their clients. This would help them to feel that they are more aware and have control over the shared content.</p>
        <img src="http://cdn.getforge.com/jeongsteph.com/1445215728/images/fbiteration.png">
        <p>
        After exploring with email preview, I realized that the modal repeated the information in the preview and in the input field. Here, I learned to throw away my initial idea to find a more intuitive way which was incorporating the input field into the preview. This idea brought me closer to making it a more human and friendly experience.</p>
        <img src="http://cdn.getforge.com/jeongsteph.com/1445215728/images/fbpreview.png">
        <p>
        During my team crits, I received the feedback that it was hard to figure out where the input field was. In order to tackle this problem, I tried a number of solutions:</br></br>
        1. numbering each step</br>
        2. using hover states</br>
        3. Blue's clues</br>
        4. Using icons</br>
        </p>
        <h5>Building trust and making sure the user feels secured using the sharing platform.</h5>
        <img src="http://cdn.getforge.com/jeongsteph.com/1445215728/images/fbsecurity.png">
        <p>One of the biggest concerns with the sharing tool was how we can make sure that the users would feel secured sharing their business information online. I have explored different options such as providing a special url for each plan or assigning a password. I decided on letting the users secure their business plans with a password would be a good solution becuase it felt more personal than just providing a special link. By providing a prefilled password, I expedited the process of securing the plan, but I also made it an option for them to edit the password however they wanted.</p>

        </ul>
        <h5>Understanding how much information a user may need to understand and learn a new design.</h5>
        <p>After trying out these designs, I got a feedback from both my researcher and content strategist that using all of these features may be too much handholding through the experience. In the end, I found a solution that gives the user enough information and trust the users enough to take out unnecessary information.</br>

        <h5>Be friends with developers.</h5>
        <p>For the 12 weeks at SAP, I learned an immense amount of lesson ranging from creating a prototype to communicating with others to bring a product to life. I learned to be proactive to get feedback and develop my product into its full potential. I also learned to break out of the comfort zone to try something completely different, which brought me closer to achieving the initial project goals. </br>
        </br>
        I also learned how to take initiative to bring an awesome idea into an actual product. I participated in a Hackathon with a project manager from the Protect and Care team, engineers, and designers to design something we were all passionate about. With this idea, we got our product placed in the innovation center of one of the world's bestest retailers. I can’t share the project publicly, but if you would like to know more about this hackathon project, <a href="mailto:jeongsteph@gmail.com">drop me an email</a>! </p>
