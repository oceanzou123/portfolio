        <h2>SpotsChecker</h2>
        <h4>Product Design</h4>
        <p>I joined SAP Lab Canada in 2015 as an interaction designer under their emerging technology team. During my time there, I work with developers to design and develop <strong>SpotChecker</strong>, an in-house DNA Testing iPad application, to mitigate food fraud in retailer's supply chain.</p>

        <h5>Food fraud is widespread</h5>

        <p>I began the process by understanding the problem space for target audience groups. Firstly, I researched on what is food fraud and understand that it is widespread nowadays. </p>

        <h5>Retailers are feeling the pain of food fraud</h5>
        <p>Under this context, retailers are feeling the pain of food fraud due to the following reasons: </p>

        <ul>
            <li><h3>Ideation</h3></li>
            <li><div class="divider"></div></li>
        </ul>

    <h5>What if retailer can find out food fraud issue in house?</h5>
        <p>Normally, the communication among retailers and lab is time consuming. It took at least two weeks to test a product in external lab and return it back to retailer. The spend on lab testing is also costly and retailer can't make massive amount test. If retailer can do food fraud testing in their own distribution center, it saves times and money!

        <h5>Digestible human design that integrate with hardware. </h5>
        <br><br>        
        <p>
        In order to understand the retailer's traditional food fraud testing process, we simulated the lab tesing environment. Via the simulation, I realized that the testing process is trivial but not hard to process. The pain point is read, understand, and follow the scientifc termonology on instruction. Therefore, to deliever in-house testing solution, the key is to deliever human design that can faciliate learning how to test and make test task easier.

        <h5>Be friends with developers.</h5>
        <p>For the 12 weeks at SAP, I learned an immense amount of lesson ranging from creating a prototype to communicating with others to bring a product to life. I learned to be proactive to get feedback and develop my product into its full potential. I also learned to break out of the comfort zone to try something completely different, which brought me closer to achieving the initial project goals. </br>
        </br>
        I also learned how to take initiative to bring an awesome idea into an actual product. I participated in a Hackathon with a project manager from the Protect and Care team, engineers, and designers to design something we were all passionate about. With this idea, we got our product placed in the innovation center of one of the world's bestest retailers. I canâ€™t share the project publicly, but if you would like to know more about this hackathon project, <a href="mailto:jeongsteph@gmail.com">drop me an email</a>! </p>
